<h1 align="center">Agify Age Predictor</h1>
<p align="center"> This is a simple Android app that predicts a person's age based on their name using the Agify API. The app is built following the MVVM architecture, utilizing Retrofit for network calls, and Jetpack Compose for building the UI.</p>
<p> Uses the Agify API - https://agify.io/documentation </p>
</br>

## Features
- Enter a name and get the predicted age for that name.
- Clean architecture using MVVM pattern for separation of concerns.
- Retrofit is used to handle the network request to the Agify API.
- Jetpack Compose is used to create a modern, declarative UI.

## Tech Stack
- MVVM Architecture
- Jetpack Compose for the UI
- Retrofit for making network requests
- Hilt for dependency injection (if used)
- Kotlin Coroutines for background threading

## How It Works
- The user can press one of the buttons to get the predicted age for predefined names.
- The app makes a network call to the Agify API using Retrofit to fetch the age based on the name.
- The response from the API is displayed in the UI using Jetpack Compose.
- The app follows the MVVM pattern to separate the business logic from the UI.
